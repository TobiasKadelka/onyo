# Demo Generation

This directory contains the necessary bits to generate a demo repository for
Onyo. A public version of the [Onyo Demo Repo](https://github.com/psyinfra/onyo-demo/)
is available, and is generated and updated automatically when anything is pushed
to `main`.

The primary script is `generate_demo_repo.sh`:

```
./generate_demo_repo.sh /tmp/onyo-demo
```
