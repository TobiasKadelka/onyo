# create a set of rules that can be used for other directories with help of a
# pointer. This helps to use the same set of validation rules for all user
# directories:
# "generic_rules_for_users/**": &pointer_user
# - RAM:
#   - Type: int
# - USB:
#   - Type: int

# use the pointer created above to use the same rules for all user directories:
# "user1/**":
#   *pointer_user
# "user2/**":
#   *pointer_user

# define additional rules for all files with "laptop" in name that are in folder
# shelf:
# "shelf/*laptop*":
# - RAM:
#   - Type: int

# all assets, that don't have laptop in name, but are in shelf or it's
# sub-directories:
# "shelf/**":
# - RAM:
#   - Type: float

# for all directories that are not specified above, create a fallback rule:
# "**":
# - CPU:
#   - Type: int
